# flex-css
A simple CSS library to use flexbox seamlessly in your app.

## Getting Started
Choose one of the files to download from the `dist` directory.
* `flex.css` - The unprefixed, unminified source file. Read this one!
* `flex.min.css` - Minified source. Use this one if you are not worried about browser support.
* `flex.min.prefixed.css` - Prefixed and minified source.

Use the class `flex` on the parent element you would like to apply flexbox layout to:
* `flex horizontal` applies flexbox with horizontal layout
* `flex vertical` applies flexbox with vertical layout
* `flex horizontal reverse` applies flexbox with horizontal layout reversed
* `flex vertical reverse` applies flexbox with vertical layout reversed
